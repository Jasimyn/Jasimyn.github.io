I received B.Eng. degree in optoelectronic information science and engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2022. 

Presently, I am a Master Student at Zhejiang University, co-advised by Prof. [Qi Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0098047) and Prof. [Huajun Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0086127). 
My research focuses on multi-frame image restoration for rotating rectangular synthetic aperture imaging and some other low-level tasks. 

**Research interest:** Optics, Computational Photography, Deep Learning, Low-level Computer Vision, Hybrid Optics and Advanced Imaging Devices.
